# Sonification: Sounding and Listening as Critical Practice

The sounds of data are all around us: from phone notifications to car horns to the whistle at a sports game. In this two-part workshop, participants will be introduced to the theory and practice of data sonification. We will briefly delve into the history of sonification and think through the unique ways that humans process and communicate sonic information. In the first session, through interactive exercises, like virtual sound walks, participants will be introduced to approaches and theories of listening to sound critically and reflectively.

Register for the second session here: [Sonification: Communicating Data with Sound](sonification2)
