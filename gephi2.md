# Gephi Part 2: Conducting Netwrok Analysis

This workshop will build on the [Fall 2023 workshop "Gephi Part 1: Introduction to Network Visualizations"](gephi1) to look at how one can conduct network analysis for research. We will go through a case example together and discuss more features that researchers can use to design their own network visualizations.
