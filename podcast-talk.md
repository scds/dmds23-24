# Podcasting for Academics with Jeff Goodes: How to Connect with Your Audience

Podcasts can take academic research out of the ivory tower and into the public. Learn how to connect with your audience and build an online listenership at this roundtable discussion hosted by special guest Jeff Goodes, veteran CBC reporter and the 2023 journalist-in-residence for McMaster's Faculty of Science.
 
This speaker event is part of the Intro to Podcasting workshop series. These beginner-friendly sessions walk through each step of the production process: from conceptualising a story idea to recording interviews to sound design.
