# Empowering Diversity in STEM Academia: Hoops and Lab Coat

Embracing my identity as a first-generation Latina while embarking on a doctoral journey in STEM fills me with a sense of pride. However, this remarkable pursuit is not without its trials, which are progressively gaining prominence in our discourse. "Hoops and Lab Coat" serves as a narrative vessel, where I use the power of storytelling through cartoons to bring my life as a scientist to vivid life. In this talk, Iâ€™ll share this work in progress journey that combines personal experience with history, highlighting the power of diversity in shaping a more equitable and inclusive future in STEM and academia.
