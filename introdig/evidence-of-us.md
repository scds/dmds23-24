# Evidence of Us: Exploring Potential Futures of the “Queer” Archive

Evidence of Us is a four-part podcast series dedicated to exploring the different considerations necessary to 2SLGBTQ+ archives seeking to expand their collections to include gender diverse materials. Through conversations with scholars and community members, the show explores solely transgender and Two-Spirit archives to learn about what complications arise when queer archives seek to expand ethically. Additionally, the show situates these findings in the context of Hamilton’s Two-Spirit and queer communities amidst a tumultuous political and social climate, specifically focusing on the newly formed Hamilton 2SLGBTQ+ Community Archive and their recent efforts to expand. In my presentation, I will discuss how making space in the archive for further marginalized communities (in tandem with boosting their public-accessibility) is essential to strengthening the confidence of these communities today.
