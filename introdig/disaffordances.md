# Navigating Platform (Dis)affordances: Rhetorics of Suspension

Various digital platforms analyze user interests, identities, and behaviours, categorizing users into hierarchies that impact the ways that users (can) engage on the platform. In the case of marginalized communities and their activisms, these processes lead to account suspension, shadow banning and otherwise silencing. In this talk, I will share the preliminary findings from my critical discourse analysis of 35,000 tweets with the keyword “suspended”. Analyzing the sharing of user experiences and understandings of platform suspension, I explore the ways in which platforms limit how we can participate and the possible factors that make these suspensions possible.
