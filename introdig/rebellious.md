# The Rebellious Female Body: An Analysis of Street-based Nude Activism in Women, Life, Freedom Movement on Iranian Twittersphere

*The Rebellious Female Body* examines the efforts of two Iranian feminist activists who practiced street-based nude activism during the Women, Life, Freedom movement in 2022. These activists constructed a unique form of bodily resistance against various forms of state and social corporeal regulation imposed on Iranian women. In this talk, I will share preliminary findings of a discourse analysis of Iranian Twitter users' reactions to nude feminism. I will consider how the resuscitation of the naked female bodily protest is a transformative and transgressive tool within the Iranian womenâ€™s movement that has intensified the long resistances of Iranian women for corporeal autonomy.
