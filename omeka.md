Create next level digital exhibits! We will use HTML5 to customize the appearance of your Omeka S digital exhibit and add interactive elements to your website. 

Preliminary Work/Prerequisites: This workshop is suited to folks who are already using Omeka S. If you would like to learn about the Omeka S digital exhibit platform, watch the Sherman Centre's asynchronous learning module ahead of this workshop and create an exhibit to work on.
