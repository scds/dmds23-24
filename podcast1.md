# Intro to Podcasting: Interviewing and Recording

Podcasts can take academic research out of the ivory tower and into the public. Learn how at this beginner-friendly workshop. Participants will create a 5-minute research story and, in the process, gain hands-on experience producing podcasts, from pitching an idea to building an online listenership. The Intro to Podcasting series will be split into two parts. This first session will introduce participants to the art of interviewing, as well as tips and tricks for recording studio-quality sound using the Lyons New Media Centre recording booths.

**Veteran radio journalist Jeff Goodes, producer of CBC's White Coat, Black Art and McMaster's 2023 journalist-in-residence, will host a 1-hr roundtable discussion prior to the workshop from 12:30-1:20pm in the Sherman Centre.*
