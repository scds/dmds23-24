Don't lose all that hard work you've put into creating a digital scholarship project! With all the moving parts involved, digital scholarship projects can “break” two or three years after completion when preservation concerns aren’t considered. Websites require maintenance, platforms like Omeka and StoryMaps need version updates, file formats become obsolete – making projects interactive and accessible over the long-term can be complex.

In this roundtable discussion, we’ll explore challenges in preserving digital scholarship projects, as well as tools & approaches to supporting their long-term access and use. We’ll conclude with a sandbox session where we share case studies and respond to participant questions.
