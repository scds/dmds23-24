# Mobile Connexions and Material Culture

Across the world, complex ecosystems of mobile internet tools have evolved in conjunction with cultural and socioeconomic activities. Through mobile internet, people in Nigeria can engage in banking, business, education, entertainment, spirituality, and more. Yet, significant disparities exist in mobile internet use across urban and rural demographics. This project explores how Nigerians interact with mobile internet in daily activities using a gamified interface built on Twine. It considers the material consequences of mobile internet and emphasizes use-centered design approaches that promote inclusivity for vulnerable persons.  By studying the connections between mobile internet use and contemporary material culture, this project seeks to understand how modern people and societies are shaped by and shape communications technology.
