Learn to graph data and visualize networks at this virtual workshop on Gephi. Participants will learn how graph data can help express relationships between entities and visualize networks for Humanities scholars. The group will use a visualization tool intended for social network analysis to map and identify relationships.

Preliminary Work/Prerequisites: Participants may download Gephi ahead of time, though there will be time during the workshop to download the program as well.
