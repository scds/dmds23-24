# Less is More: Create Minimal Websites with Jekyll

In this workshop, students will learn how to build a lightweight website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

Website-building platforms, like Squarespace and Wordpress, while convenient and user-friendly, can be costly, have limited customizability, and require continuous updates to stay afloat. Static sites, on the other hand, are pure html, css, and javascript. As such, they are free to build, endlessly customizable and, once generated, require little to no maintenance.

Jekyll is an open-source static site generator that offers the best of both worlds. In this workshop, students will start with a basic Jekyll website template. Then, we will walk through how to create and edit pages in Markdown, an easy to understand word processing language (like simpler html) that was created for blogging. Next we will explore how to customize the layout and design with CSS. Finally, students will learn how to deploy and host their finished site (for free!) on GitHub Pages.
