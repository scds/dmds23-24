         In the last year and a half, Canadians have faced the crisis of a century. And we             have faced it together.                     Across the country, you put on your mask to keep your neighbours safe. You cheered             on our frontline workers. And, when it was your turn, you rolled up your sleeves to             get your vaccine.                    You did your part. You stayed true to who we are as Canadians. And so did we.           From day one, our Liberal Government has stood up for the middle class and people             working hard to join it. We raised taxes on the wealthiest one percent, so we could             lower them for everyone else. We brought in the Canada Child Benefit, putting more             money in the pockets of families and lifting 435,000 children out of poverty. We lowered             the retirement age from 67 to 65. We welcomed 1,613,000 new Canadians whose hard work             and passion for a brighter future make our communities stronger. We committed Canada             to net-zero emissions and put a price on pollution. We invested in our communities,             in roads, bridges, and transit. We committed to doing more for mental health services,             for home care, and began to transform our economy so that everyone could benefit.                                 When this crisis hit, we knew we had to continue having your back. From the Canada             Emergency Response Benefit to rolling out vaccines, that's exactly what we did.                     Canada has weathered this storm better than almost anywhere else in the world because             we know we're in this together.                    So, as we finish the fight against COVID-19, let's build back better, together.           Let's put Canadians' health and safety first. Let's build more homes for the middle             class and put a stop to profiteering and unfair speculation. Let's support women and             families and give every child the best possible start with $10 a day child care. Let's             fight climate change and leave a safe and healthy environment for our children and             grandchildren. Let's keep moving forward on real reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.             Let's come together to fight systemic racism. Let's find the real solutions to the             real problems we face. Let's build a better future that gives everyone a real and             fair chance at success.                    We can't afford to move backward. Not in the fight against COVID-19 or the climate             crisis. Not on healthcare or childcare. Not for seniors, workers, or families.                    This is our moment to decide where our country goes from here. This is our time to             choose. And this platform is our path ahead for generations to come.                     Forward or backward. This is our choice.          I believe in moving forward.

For Everyone. 2           Finishing the Fight Against COVID-19 Leadership should always be about putting peoples'             health and safety first. Canadians have sacrificed so much over the pandemic and have             stepped up to protect themselves and their communities by getting their shots. Colder             weather is just around the corner. Canadians have a choice: continue taking action             to finish the fight against COVID-19 now or risk a fall and winter with more lockdowns             and the tragedy of more lives lost. Canadians have made too many sacrifices to get             this far. Canadians deserve a government that will get us through this crisis, not             take us backward.                     A Vaccine Strategy to Save Lives Vaccination is our best line of defence against COVID-19             and variants of concern. It not only protects those who are vaccinated but protects             those who can't get vaccinated, like young children. That is why the Liberal government             worked tirelessly to secure enough doses for every Canadian citizen, securing our             supply well in advance of our initial target. And it is why we support provinces,             territories, and Indigenous communities in rolling out one of the most successful             vaccination campaigns in the world.                     But the pandemic isn't over. If we don't keep up the fight against COVID-19, our hard-won             gains could be lost.                     Erin O'Toole won't listen to the experts on vaccinations. He would let unvaccinated             people travel on trains and planes. We need leadership to get us through this crisis             and get the job done on vaccines, and Erin O'Toole won't deliver that.                     Mandatory Vaccination  To finish the fight against COVID-19, protect people at work,             ensure businesses can get back up to speed, and, most importantly, make sure our kids             can safely return to school, we need to do everything we can to keep public spaces             safe.                      A re-elected Liberal government will:           ‚Ä¢ Require that travellers on interprovincial trains, commercial flights, cruise ships,             and other federally regulated vessels be vaccinated.                     ‚Ä¢ Ensure vaccination across the federal public service. As the country's largest employer,             this will protect the health and safety of the federal public servants and their communities,             across Canada.                     ‚Ä¢ We will also keep working with employers in Crown corporations and federally regulated             workplaces to ensure vaccination is prioritized for workers in these sectors.                     Proof of Vaccination Canadians want to finish the fight against COVID-19. Millions             of Canadians have rolled up their sleeves and gotten their vaccine shots, doing so             to protect themselves, and their community. Across the country, thousands of business             owners have demonstrated leadership to support vaccine rollout, and now many want             to go further. Whether they are managing a multinational or a small coffee shop, business             owners should have no doubt that putting the safety of workers, customers, or clients             first is the right thing to do.                     Proof of vaccination systems give people the confidence of knowing that others around             them are fully vaccinated. They also help drive increased vaccination rates and give             Canadians confidence that it's safe to go to restaurants, shops, and out into their             communities.                     A re-elected Liberal government will:           ‚Ä¢ Launch a $1 billion COVID-19 Proof of Vaccination Fund to support provinces and             territories who implement a requirement for proof of vaccine credentials in their             jurisdiction for non-essential businesses and public spaces.                      ‚Ä¢ Table legislation to ensure that every business and organization that decides to             require a proof of vaccination from employees and customers can do so without fear             of a legal challenge.                     Free COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters As the public health situation evolves, keeping Canadians             safe and healthy is our priority and we are committed to finishing the fight against             COVID-19.                      A re-elected Liberal government will:           ‚Ä¢ Procure enough vaccines to ensure all Canadians have access to free COVID-19 booster             shots and second-generation vaccines as needed.                                                        Forward. For Everyone. 3           A COVID-19 Research Fund COVID-19 is a new disease and scientists and researchers             have come a long way to understand, treat, and prevent it. But we still need to understand             its long-term impacts.                      A re-elected Liberal government will:           ‚Ä¢ Invest $100 million to study the long-term health impacts of COVID-19, including             the effects of long-COVID on different groups, including vulnerable populations             and children.                     A Health Care System, For Everyone Canadians are proud to have a public health care             system that is a model to the world. That didn't happen by accident. It is the result             of Canadians' belief that we take care of each other. Accessible, well-funded public             health care is a cornerstone of equality in Canada. And it has been invaluable as             we have fought the pandemic. We cannot take our public health care system for granted.                                 From day one of the pandemic, we made significant investments to ensure Canadians             have the health care they need. Eight out of every 10 dollars spent in response to             COVID-19 came from the Liberal government. From investing in pandemic surge capacity,             public health care and the Safe Restart Agreement, to moving forward on pharmacare             and procuring vaccines for every single Canadian, we have had Canadians' backs.                     Key Actions to Build a Better Health Care System, Since 2015            Injected $4.5 billion in one-time top-ups to the Canada Health Transfer since the             pandemic started, to help address the extreme pressures that COVID-19 has put on our             health systems and reduce backlogs.                       Provided provinces and territories with $1 billion to support vaccine rollout campaigns             so Canadians could get their first and second doses as quickly as possible.                      Invested an additional $6 billion in home care and community care, as well as palliative             care services.                      Invested more than $600 million to address the opioid crisis and improve access to             treatment.                      Signed the first provincial-territorial agreement to accelerate the implementation             of national universal pharmacare as we continue to move forward with new partners             and funded a $500 million a year national strategy for high-cost drugs for rare diseases.                                 Eliminating the Backlog of Surgeries and Procedures  Too many Canadians had their             care deferred during the pandemic, resulting in a significant backlog of surgeries,             procedures, and diagnostics. But waitlists from before the pandemic persist as well.             People are waiting longer for important services like MRIs and ultrasounds.                      A re-elected Liberal government will:           ‚Ä¢ Immediately invest $6 billion‚Äîon top of $4 billion already committed‚Äîto support             the elimination of health system waitlists.                      ‚Ä¢ Negotiate agreements with every province and territory to ensure that Canadians             who are waiting for care get the treatment they need as quickly as possible, and that             the primary care system is positioned for the future and able to deliver the care             outcomes that Canadians need.                     Making Sure Every Canadian Has Access to a Family Doctor or Primary Health Team Millions             of Canadians face problems accessing primary care. We want to help solve this problem             and improve Canadians' access to universal, public health care.                     A re-elected Liberal government will:           ‚Ä¢ Provide $3.2 billion to the provinces and territories for the hiring of 7,500 new             family doctors, nurses, and nurse practitioners.                      Expanding Virtual Health Care Services  The pandemic has sparked a transformation             in how health care is delivered and how people access it, with more and more tools             accessible for virtual care. We have dedicated $240.5 million to increasing access             to virtual care in the pandemic. But we want to and will help ensure that the fast             acceleration of care into virtual models is thoughtful and delivers the quality of             care Canadians deserve.                     A re-elected Liberal government will:           ‚Ä¢ Provide $400 million over 4 years to build on the growing demand for virtual care             that arose during the pandemic.                      These dollars will help to cover digital infrastructure, and other system improvements,             to support more virtual care so that Canadians can access things like virtual medical             consultations with doctors and nurses or remote monitoring.                                                         Forward. For Everyone. 4           Increasing Rural and Underserved Communities' Access to Health Care  Rural Canadians             have significantly less access to doctors than Canadians in urban settings.                     A re-elected Liberal government will:           ‚Ä¢ Expand the number of family doctors and primary health teams in rural communities,             by increasing by 50% (from $40,000 up to $60,000 over 5 years), the maximum debt relief             that family doctors, residents in family medicine, nurse practitioners, or nurses             are eligible for the under Canada Student Loans forgiveness program.                      ‚Ä¢ Expand the list of professionals eligible for forgiveness to include dentists, pharmacists,             dental hygienists, midwives, social workers, psychologists, teachers, and early childhood             educators so that rural communities have greater access to the full suite of health             and social service providers they need.                      ‚Ä¢ Offer health care professionals, who are just starting out in their careers, a one-time             income tax deduction of up to $15,000 over their first 3 years of practice to help             with the costs of setting up a practice.                      ‚Ä¢ Undertake a review to ensure that communities that are indeed rural are fully eligible             under the program.
