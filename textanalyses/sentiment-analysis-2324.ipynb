Introduction\n","In this exercise we're going to explore Sentiment Analysis, a natural language processing technique to ascribe a sentiment valence to language. This type of analysis is useful in a variety of contexts, including:\n","- Assessing perception of and affinity for products and performances from user reviews.\n","- Characterizing discourse around subjects and individuals from dialogue in correspondence text, social media data, etc.\n","- Assisting in rhetorical analyses of written text or spoken communications.  \n","\n","And before we begin, a shout out to the excellent tutorials that have inspired various aspects of this exercise:\n","- Real Python's [Sentiment Analysis: First Steps With Python's NLTK Library](https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis/)\n","- The [VADER documentation](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)\n","- Towards Data Science's [Social Media Sentiment Analysis In Python With VADER](https://towardsdatascience.com/social-media-sentiment-analysis-in-python-with-vader-no-training-required-4bc6a21e87b8)\n","- Constellate's [Sentiment analysis with vader](https://github.com/ithaka/constellate-notebooks/blob/master/sentiment-analysis-with-vader.ipynb) tutorial."],"metadata":{"id":"SrjbG-tuMCw1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Rule-based vs. machine learning approaches\n","Sentiment analysis methods are generally of two types: rule-based algorithms and machine learning models.  \n","\n","From Nathan Kelber and JSTOR Labs' [Constellate tutorial on sentiment analysis](https://github.com/ithaka/constellate-notebooks/blob/master/sentiment-analysis-with-vader.ipynb):\n","\n","> **Rule-based algorithms** assign sentiment scores to particular words or multi-word constructions. Simple algorithms may simply assess each word individually in a feedback document and add up an overall score. More complex algorithms may assess multi-word (or n-gram) constructions and have special rules for addressing issues such as negation, emojis, and emoticons. They can detect the difference between \"bad\", \"not bad\", and \"bad ass\". Some algorithms also support emojis and emoticons, such as \"=)\" and \"😁\".\n","\n","> **Machine learning models** rely on feedback data that has already been assessed by humans to have a particular sentiment. Each piece of feedback is **labeled** by a human reader who may place the feedback into a particular category. The categories could be as simple as positive, negative, or neutral. As long as there exists **labeled** data, a machine learning model can often identify complex concepts. For example, a car manufacturer may desire to classify the sentiment of feedback from past buyers as: \"budget-conscious\", \"eco-conscious\", \"tech-enthusiastic\", \"luxury-driven\", \"performance-driven\", etc. Assuming there is an adequately labeled **training data** for each of these categories, a machine learning model could assign a score for each category. This could help analysts understand the brand better, answering questions about what consumers do or do not like about a particular vehicle."],"metadata":{"id":"iJOG3LNeDZbF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### VADER\n","For this exercise, we will use a tool called [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) (**V**alence **A**ware **D**ictionary and s**E**ntiment **R**easoner) -- a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analyzer that is specifically targeted towards social media data, but also useful for some other forms of text and media.\n","\n","VADER is built into the [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/) (NLTK), a comprehensive, popular, and powerful python-based platform for natural language processing. VADER is ready-to-use, so you can get started quickly with sentiment analysis. It also means that you should be critical of the results, especially if you don't know how the analyzer works. i.e., reading the [documentation](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/tree/master) is a good idea!\n","\n","A notable benefit of using a rule-based algorithm like VADER is that the methods are transparent and interrogable.
